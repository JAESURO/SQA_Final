## Testing

The `Testing` folder contains automated end-to-end tests for the web application using Selenium and Pytest. The main script, `fin.py`, performs registration and login tests, capturing logs and screenshots for each run. Test dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

To run the tests:

```bash
cd Testing
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest fin.py --html=reports/report.html
```

- Test logs are saved in the `logs/` directory.
- Screenshots are saved in the `screenshots/` directory.
- HTML reports are generated in the `reports/` directory.
